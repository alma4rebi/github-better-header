# GitHub Better Header
## We love the previous header!
![GitHub Better Header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/itchyny/github-better-header/image.png)

## Why?
- The Pull request and Issues links are welcome.
- But we miss the profile link in the header.
- There are some other projects which aim as same as this project, but their scripts are loaded after the contents are loaded. Thus the header gets better after a few hundreds of milliseconds. On the other hand, this extension replaces the elements before the document is loaded.

## Requirements
- Google Chrome

## Installation
- Clone this repository
- Click Load unpacked extension button in the chrome://extensions/.
